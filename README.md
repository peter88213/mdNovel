# mdnovel

Novel writing tool using markdown.

This is a variant of the [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre) novel writing application. 

The differences to *novelibre*: 

- All section content in *mdnovel* is Markdown-formatted.
- *mdnovel* comes with a Markdown section editor. The user is not supposed to export the text for editing. 
- *mdnovel* saves the project in a YAML/Markdown based file format instead of the XML based *.novx* format.
- There is no connection with OpenOffice/libreOffice. 
- Document export is in Markdown or csv format. 
- New project can be created from Markdown-formatted Work-in-progress or outline.

Users may want to install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for processing the documents exported from *mdnovel*.
