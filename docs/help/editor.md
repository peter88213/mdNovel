# Section editor

## Launch the section editor

Open a section editor window by double-clicking on a section, or via the
**Section \> Edit** menu entry when a section is selected, or by hitting
the `Enter` key.

---

**Note**

-   If you choose a section already open, the window will be brought to
    the foreground.

---

## Select text

-   Select a word via double-clicking.
-   Select a paragraph via triple-clicking.
-   Extend the selection via `Shift`-`Arrow`.
-   Extend the selection to the next word via `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`Arrow`.
-   `Ctrl`-`A` selects the whole text.

## Copy/Paste text

-   `Ctrl`-`C` copies the selected text to the clipboard.
-   `Ctrl`-`X` cuts the selected text and moves it to the clipboard.
-   `Ctrl`-`V` pastes the clipboard text content to the cursor position.

## Format text

-   `Ctrl`-`I` places \"emphasized\" markup around the selected text or
    at the cursor, like so:

    `*Example*`{.md}

    If the selection is already emphasized, the command removes the
    markup.

-   `Ctrl`-`B` places \"strong\" markup around the selected text or at
    the cursor, like so:

    `**Example**`{.md}

    If the selection is already strong, the command removes the markup.

-   `Ctrl`-`M` removes \"emphasized\" and \"strong\" markup from the
    selection.

## Undo/Redo

-   `Ctrl`-`Z` undoes the last editing. Multiple undo is possible.
-   `Ctrl`-`Y` redoes the last undo. Multiple redo is possible.

## Split a section

With **File \> Split at cursor position** or `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`S`, you can
split the section at the cursor position.

-   All the text from the cursor position is cut and pasted into a newly
    created section.
-   The new section is placed after the currently edited section.
-   The new section is
    [appended](../section_view.html#append-to-previous-section) to the
    currently edited section.
-   The new section has the same status as the currently edited section.
-   The new section is of the same type as the currently edited section.
-   The new section has the same viewpoint character as the currently
    edited section.
-   The editor loads the newly created section.

## Create a section

With **File \> Create section** or `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`N`, you can create a
section.

-   The new section is placed after the currently edited section.
-   The new section is of the same type as the currently edited section.
-   The editor loads the newly created section.

## Word count

-   The section word count is displayed at the status bar at the bottom
    of the window.
-   By default, word count is updated manually, either by pressing the
    `F5` key, or via the **Word count \> Update** menu entry.
-   The word count can be updated \"live\", i.e.Â just while entering
    text. This is enabled or disabled via the **Word count \> Live
    update** menu checkbox.


---

**Note**

Live updating the word count is resource intensive and may slow down the
program when editing big sections. This is why it's disabled by default.

---

## Apply changes

With `Ctrl`-`S`, you can apply changes to the section. Then \"Modified\"
status is displayed in *novelibre*.

---

**Note**

Before applying changes, the program checks the editor content for XML
validity. Malformed XML will not be accepted.

---

## Close the editor window

-   To close the editor window, click on the **Close** button, or just
    close the window.
-   Under Windows you can optionally exit with **Section \> Exit** or
    `Alt`-`F4`.
-   Otherwise you can optionally exit with **Section \> Quit** or
    `Ctrl`-`Q`.
-   When closing the editor window, you will be asked for applying
    changes.
